    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> The recipe starts with 1 ½ cups white sugar. </li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Beat the sugar with two sticks of softened butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Two eggs lend moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together.  </li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  </li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> They wouldn’t be chocolate chocolate chip cookies without cocoa powder!  </li>
        <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.  </li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won’t make the cookies taste salty.  </li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour gives the cookie dough structure.  </li>
        <li><strong>Chocolate chips:</strong> You’ll need two cups of semisweet chocolate chips.  </li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts (optional):</strong> Walnuts are optional, but they add welcome crunch.  </li>
    </ul>
